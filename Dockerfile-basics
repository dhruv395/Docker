## A text file with instructions to build image

The ENTRYPOINT specifies a command that will always be executed when the container starts.
The CMD specifies arguments that will be fed to the ENTRYPOINT
ENTRYPOINT can also be overridden using --entrypoint flag.
 
Both CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions define what command gets executed when running a container. There are few rules that describe their co-operation.

Dockerfile should specify at least one of CMD or ENTRYPOINT commands.
ENTRYPOINT should be defined when using the container as an executable.
CMD should be used as a way of defining default arguments for an ENTRYPOINT command or for executing an ad-hoc command in a container.
CMD will be overridden when running the container with alternative arguments.

example:
For example, if your Dockerfile is:

FROM debian:wheezy
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/ping"]
CMD ["localhost"]


FROM	ubuntu 					          		   	-> to get a base image

MAINTAINER  dhruv  <dray1@raytech.com>

#Set one or more individual labels			    -> add labels to your image to help organize images by project, 
									                      		- record licensing information, to aid in automation
LABEL 	com.example.version="0.0.1-beta"
LABEL 	vendor1="ACME Incorporated"

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \      -> gets executed during the bulding of the image
											                        	- builds your application with make	
										                           -Always combine RUN apt-get update with apt-get install in the same RUN statement
    package-bar \
    package-baz \
    package-foo  \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR							                    		-> WORKDIR command changes default directory, where we run our RUN / CMD / ENTRYPOINT commands

COPY							                    		-> adds files from your Docker clientâ€™s current directory

ADD							                    			->  for downloading remote files and extracting archives

CMD	["echo", "Hello world"] 		        	-> specifies what command to run within the container
CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]    -commands gets executed only when you create a container out of the image
CMD ["apache2","-DFOREGROUND"]      	    -is a default command run after creating container without other command specified.

ENTRYPOINT								-> 

ENV									                  	-> to update the PATH environment variable for the software your container installs

EXPOSE		80  443				            		-> indicates the ports on which a container listens for connections

VOLUME								                	-> should be used to expose any database storage area, configuration storage, 
										                    - or files/folders created by your docker container
