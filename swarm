Docker Swarm is a tool for Container Orchestration.
Letâ€™s take an example
You have 100 containers

You need to do 
- Health check on every container
- Ensure all containers are up on every system
- Scaling the containers up or down depending on the load
- Adding updates/changes to all the containers

Orchestration - managing and controlling multiple docker containers as a single service
Tools available - Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Apache Mesos

Pre-requisite:
1. Docker 1.13 or higher 
2. Docker Machine (pre installed for Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac)
for Linux: https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/

base=https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.16.0 &&
  curl -L $base/docker-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) >/tmp/docker-machine &&
  sudo install /tmp/docker-machine /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

docker-machine -v                                                           #Now run to check version

Create Docker machines (to act as nodes for Docker Swarm) Create one machine as manager and others as workers  
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox manager1
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox worker1

if you get this error while creating docker machines in ubuntu:
"VBoxManage not found. Make sure VirtualBox is installed and VBoxManage is in the path"
Then 
apt-get install virtualbox
which VirtualBox
Again run, 
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox manager         ## it should work now

Step 2 :  Check machine created successfully
    docker-machine ls
    docker-machine ip manager1


Step 3 :  SSH (connect) to docker machine
    docker-machine ssh manager1


Step 4 :  Initialize Docker Swarm    docker swarm init --advertise-addr MANAGER_IP
    docker node ls
    (this command will work only in swarm manager and not in worker)


Step 5 :  Join workers in the swarm
    Get command for joining as worker
    In manager node run command
    docker swarm join-token worker
    This will give command to join swarm as worker

    docker swarm join-token manager
    This will give command to join swarm as manager

    SSH into worker node (machine) and run command to join swarm as worker
   
    In Manager Run command - docker node ls to verify worker is registered and is ready
  
    Do this for all worker machines


Step 6 :  On manager run standard docker commands
    docker info
    check the swarm section 
    no of manager, nodes etc

    Now check docker swarm command options 
    docker swarm 


Step 7 :  Run containers on Docker Swarm
    docker service create --replicas 3 -p 80:80 --name serviceName nginx

    Check the status:
    docker service ls
    docker service ps serviceName
   
    Check the service running on all nodes
    Check on the browser by giving ip for all nodes


Step 8 :  Scale service up and down
   On manager node 
   docker service scale serviceName=2
 

Inspecting Nodes (this command can run only on manager node)
docker node inspect nodename
docker node inspect self
docker node inspect worker1


Step 9 : Shutdown node
   docker node update --availability drain worker1


Step 10 :  Update service
   docker service update --image imagename:version web
   docker service update --image nginx:1.14.0 serviceName


Step 11 :  Remove service
   docker service rm serviceName


docker swarm leave : to leave the swarm
docker-machine stop machineName : to stop the machine
docker-machine rm machineName : to remove the machine
